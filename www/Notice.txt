1. when finishing loading the app, need to 
   3-4 seconds and then enter to the NearBy page,
   because it needs location and searching returned
   data from Googlemap api to initiate the Googlemap
   on this page, it takes time to returned.
   (Maybe we can use the local sensor data to reduce
   the time as you mentioned)

2. the program runs following the below orders:
   a. get user current location, b. search the location nearby information,
   c. initiate the Googlemap and show it on the NearBy page
